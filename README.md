# Cloud Optimized Operations Lab (COOL) #

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-system/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-system/actions)

Welcome to the CISA's Cloud Optimized Operations Lab (COOL).

The COOL provides ephemeral environments for performing
cybersecurity assessments. The assessment environments are isolated
from each other and are accessed via a browser-based remote desktop after
authenticating into the COOL VPN via multi-factor authentication.
After an assessment is complete, all relevant data is archived for
future use and the assessment environment is destroyed.
