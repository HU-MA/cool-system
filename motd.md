## COOL News ##

### April 2nd, 2020 ###

Heads up that we are going to be refreshing the `env0` RPT test environment this
afternoon at **1400 EDT**.  This means that new, updated instances of Guacamole
and Kali will be deployed, along with the underlying services (OpenVPN and
FreeIPA).  Be prepared to lose everything that you had previously set up on the
Kali instances.

The biggest thing that we will be rolling out is a persistent [EFS
volume](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) that can be accessed by each Kali instance.
This shared storage will be available at `/data` on each Kali.  Note that you
must use `sudo` to create any files or directories within `/data` and assign any
relevant ownership (e.g. make the group owner `vnc` or `kali-trusted` or
whatever).  We can discuss some options to automatically set this up in the
future, but for now, that is how it is.

There are a bunch of other changes being rolled out, but they are mostly under
the covers.  If you have any questions or issues with the **1400 EDT** refresh
today, please let us know ASAP.
